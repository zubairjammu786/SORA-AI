# SORA-AI
Introducing Sora, OPENAI's next text-to-video model.

Sora can create videos of up to 60 seconds featuring highly detailed scenes, complex camera motion, and multiple characters with vibrant emotions.
We’ll be taking several important safety steps ahead of making Sora available in OpenAI’s products. We are working with red teamers — domain experts in areas like misinformation, hateful content, and bias — who are adversarially testing the model.
All the clips in this video were generated directly by Sora without modification.
